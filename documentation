Document outlining where the features are to be found

1. 4 or more sections, with one of the sections having at least one sub page.

Please see index.html:25~40, where the navigation contains 6 pages and within the page of "UI UX", 3 subpages.

2. A simple form (with at least one HTML5 features)

Please see contact.html:48~77, most of the inputs are "required" as a html5 feature.
"input type="email" is another html5 feature.

3. Search engine optimized and semantic code

Through out the pages, I have put meta tag of keywords, description, and author in the head and also featured every img tag with an "alt" description.

4. Files upload to a production server with a working link provided
